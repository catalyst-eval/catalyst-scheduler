# Scheduler Singleton Implementation - April 7, 2025

## Problem

The office assignment process was running three times simultaneously at 6am, causing:
- Multiple assignment calculations for the same offices
- Redundant database operations
- Three identical daily schedule emails being sent

Root cause: Multiple SchedulerService instances were being created and initialized in both `server.ts` and `service-initializer.ts`.

## Solution

Implemented a proper singleton pattern for the SchedulerService to ensure only one instance exists across the application.

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Updated `src/lib/scheduling/scheduler-service.ts`:
- Added static `instance` property to hold the singleton instance
- Added `initialized` flag to prevent multiple initialization
- Made the constructor private to prevent direct instantiation
- Added static `getInstance()` method to access the singleton instance
- Modified `initialize()` method to check and set the `initialized` flag
- Added logging to track initialization status and prevent duplicates

#### 2. Updated `src/server.ts`:
- Changed `new SchedulerService()` to `SchedulerService.getInstance()`
- Modified `initializeServices()` call to set `initializeScheduler: false` to avoid redundant initialization
- Added detailed comments to clarify this is now the single point of initialization
- Kept the existing call to `initialize()` in the promise handler, ensuring it runs after dependencies are set

#### 3. Updated `src/lib/util/service-initializer.ts`:
- Changed `new SchedulerService()` to `SchedulerService.getInstance()`
- Updated logging message to reflect the singleton pattern
- Left the conditional initialization in place for backward compatibility
- Improved comments to reflect the new pattern

## Benefits

1. **Single Instance**: Only one SchedulerService instance will ever exist in the application, regardless of how many places try to create one
   
2. **Single Initialization**: The `initialized` flag ensures that even if multiple places call `initialize()`, the task registration only occurs once

3. **Clear Initialization Point**: All initialization now happens in one controlled location after dependencies are set up

4. **Backward Compatibility**: The code maintains compatibility with existing usage patterns

## Expected Outcome

- Office assignment process will run exactly once at each scheduled time
- Only one daily schedule email will be sent at 6am
- Better resource utilization and less confusion for staff

## Testing

Look for log entries of "SchedulerService already initialized, skipping..." which indicates that duplicate initialization attempts were successfully prevented.

Check that only a single daily schedule email is generated and sent each morning.
