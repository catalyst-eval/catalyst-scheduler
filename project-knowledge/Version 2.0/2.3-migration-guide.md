# 2.3 Migration Guide: Catalyst Scheduler Version 1.0 to 2.0

## Core Requirements

1. **Continuous Operation of Version 1.0**
   - Version 1.0 must remain fully operational throughout development
   - No disruption to daily scheduling, webhook processing, or email generation
   - Bug fixes and minor improvements to Version 1.0 continue as needed

2. **Independent Development of Version 2.0**
   - Version 2.0 development must not interfere with Version 1.0 operations
   - Separate infrastructure and resources to avoid resource contention
   - Isolated testing environments to prevent cross-contamination

3. **Seamless Transition Strategy**
   - Gradual, controlled migration of features and data
   - Parallel operation period with bidirectional data synchronization
   - Clear verification points before decommissioning any Version 1.0 component

## Migration Strategy

The migration will follow a 6-phase approach designed to maintain operational stability:

1. **Setup & Isolation** - Establish isolated development environment and infrastructure
2. **Shadow Operation** - Build Version 2.0 alongside Version 1.0 with one-way data flow
3. **Core Services Migration** - Gradually adapt core business logic with fallback mechanisms
4. **Admin Interface Development** - Build React admin interface connecting to both systems
5. **Parallel Operation** - Run both systems concurrently with bidirectional synchronization
6. **Controlled Transition** - Gradually shift operations to Version 2.0 with verification

## Detailed Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Setup & Isolation (Weeks 1-3)

1. **Create Isolated Development Branch**
   - Create `v2-development` branch from `main`

   - Ensure Version 2.0 cannot inadvertently access Version 1.0 production resources

3. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Create completely separate `.env.v2` configuration file
   - Configure development environment with Firestore emulator
   - Set up React development environment with separate port
   - Create process documentation for switching between environments

## Technical Implementation

### Branching Strategy

```
main (Version 1.0) ──────────────────────────────────────────────▶
                     │
                     ├── v2-development
                     │        │
                     │        ├── feature/firestore-integration
                     │        │
                     │        ├── feature/react-admin
                     │        │
                     │        ├── feature/data-sync
                     │        │
                     ▼        ▼
```

- `main` branch continues to receive bug fixes and minor improvements
- `v2-development` branch contains all Version 2.0 development
- Feature branches are created from `v2-development` for specific components
- No changes from `v2-development` are merged to `main` until final transition

### Synchronization Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────┐       ┌──────────────────────┐
│   Version 1.0       │       │    Version 2.0       │
│  (Google Sheets)    │◄──────┤     (Firestore)      │
└─────────────────┬───┘       └──────────┬───────────┘
                  │                      │
                  ▼                      ▼
         ┌─────────────────┐    ┌────────────────────┐
         │  Data Validator │    │ Conflict Resolver  │
         └─────────────────┘    └────────────────────┘
```

- Initially, Version 1.0 remains the primary system and source of truth
- Data flows from Version 1.0 to Version 2.0 in shadow phase
- Bidirectional sync implemented with Version 1.0 as authority
- Validation shows differences between systems
- Conflict resolution favors Version 1.0 during transition

### Firestore Structure (Reference)

The following collections will be created in Firestore:

- **appointments** - Appointment records
- **activeAppointments** - Today's appointments
- **clients** - Client profiles
- **clientAccessibility** - Client accessibility needs
- **clinicians** - Clinician information
- **offices** - Office details
- **assignmentRules** - Office assignment rules
- **settings** - System configuration
- **auditLogs** - System activity logs
- **webhookLogs** - Webhook processing logs
- **syncStatus** - Synchronization state and metadata

### Code Organization

The Version 2.0 codebase will be structured to allow for parallel operation:

```
catalyst-scheduler/
├── src/
│   ├── lib/
│   │   ├── google/          # Version 1.0 Google Sheets (unchanged)
│   │   ├── firestore/       # Version 2.0 Firestore integration
│   │   ├── sync/            # Synchronization between systems
│   │   ├── scheduling/
│   │   │   ├── v1/          # Original scheduling logic
│   │   │   └── v2/          # Firestore-optimized scheduling
│   │   └── util/
│   ├── routes/
│   │   ├── v1/              # Original API endpoints
│   │   └── v2/              # New API endpoints for Version 2.0
│   ├── server.ts            # Unified server entry point
├── client/                  # React admin interface
├── migrations/              # Data migration scripts
└── config/
    ├── v1.env              # Version 1.0 configuration
    └── v2.env              # Version 2.0 configuration
```

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Operational Continuity**:
   - Version 1.0 remains fully operational throughout migration
   - No shared resources between versions that could cause contention
   - Monitoring in place to detect any performance impact

2. **Data Integrity**:
   - Multiple verification steps for all data synchronization
   - Version 1.0 remains source of truth until full verification
   - Complete audit logging of all operations in both systems

3. **Performance Protection**:
   - Resource isolation to prevent Version 2.0 from impacting Version 1.0
   - Rate limiting on synchronization to prevent API exhaustion
   - Monitoring of Google Sheets API usage to prevent quota issues

4. **Rollback Capability**:
   - Maintain ability to revert to Version 1.0 at any point
   - Document clear decision criteria for fallback scenarios
   - Regular testing of rollback procedures

## Phased Feature Transition

| Feature | Phase | Transition Strategy |
|---------|-------|---------------------|
| Appointment Storage | Shadow → Parallel | One-way sync, then two-way sync with V1 as primary |
| Webhook Processing | Shadow → Parallel | Process in both systems, verify results match |
| Office Assignment | Parallel | Compare results between systems until verification complete |
| Daily Emails | Shadow → Parallel | Generate from both systems, send only from V1 until verified |
| Admin Interface | Replace | Build new interface with dual-system connectivity |
| Reporting | Enhance | Build enhanced reports in V2 while maintaining V1 reports |

## Migration Checkpoints

Each transition phase includes verification checkpoints:

1. **Daily Data Verification**
   - Automated comparison of appointment data between systems
   - Verification of office assignments match between systems
   - Alert on any discrepancies

2. **Weekly Integration Testing**
   - End-to-end testing of complete workflow
   - Verification of email generation
   - Validation of webhook processing

3. **Feature Flag Control**
   - Each component controllable via feature flags
   - Ability to quickly revert any component to Version 1.0
   - Gradual enablement of Version 2.0 features

4. **Go/No-Go Decision Points**
   - Clear criteria for proceeding to next migration phase
   - Required verification period before component transition
   - Management sign-off for each major transition

## Training and Documentation

1. **System Administrator Training**
   - Dual-system operation procedures
   - Monitoring and alerting
   - Troubleshooting and rollback procedures

2. **User Training**
   - Phased introduction to new interface
   - Side-by-side comparison of systems
   - Feature transition timeline

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Maintain Version 1.0 documentation throughout transition
   - Develop Version 2.0 documentation in parallel
   - Create transition-specific documentation

## Next Steps

- Document 2.1: Catalyst Scheduler Admin Interface
- Document 2.2: Catalyst Scheduler Firestore Migration
- Document 2.4: Firestore and Web Services Implementation Guide (to be created separately)
